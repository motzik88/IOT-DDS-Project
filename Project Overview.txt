Applications Logic Description
Temperature Sensor
• The sensor shall send a temperature reading at 20 Hz.
• For the sake of simplicity, the temperature shall be a random value between 10-60
degrees (integer).

Actuators
• The actuator shall send its current status upon change [Working, Degraded, Stopped].
• Within the status message, the actuator shall also provide its unique ID (integer).
o For the sake of simplicity, the ID of the actuator shall be provided as an input for
the actuator application.
states of actuators: 
working (if rcieved start command || normal temarature indication)
degraded (exreme temperature)
stopped (recieved stop command)


Start/Stop Button
• Sends a Starts/Stops command (default is Start) according to the users input.
• For the sake of simplicity:
o A stop command shall be sent every 20 seconds.
o 5 seconds after the stop command, a start command shall be sent.

Dashboard
• The dashboard shall display the last temperature reading every 1 seconds and only if it
is an extreme temperature (<20 or >40).
• The dashboard shall display the status of each actuator (upon change).
